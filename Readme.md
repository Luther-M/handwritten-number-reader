# Handwritten Number reader

This code was built on Python 3.8, so it is unknown that another version of Python could run this code.

The packages requires to run the code:
- tensorflow (2.10 and below)
- mss 
- opencv
- numpy

## Using it

To use it, run the code and let the machine learning to do the learning, it will take some times depending on the cpu or gpu performance (depends on which device tensorflow on but it is recommend to run on gpu as it is faster).

After the machine learning has completed its learning, an application will appear that shows a screenshot of a desktop. Now open a paint or any equavalent app that can be drawn onto, and align paint to the screenshot of a desktop. After that, put a black background on the paint and enjoy draw any number with a white colour. 

## Note to take about this project

- The machine learning for this code is not optimized so the accuracy of the machine learning output may vary. 
- However the accuracy of the machine learning is increasing if the numbers is drawn on the center of the screenshot.
- Due to recent update of tensorflow, some commands are depricated. Newer version on tensorflow will not run this code. (will update this issue later)
